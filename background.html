                    Xiao is an illuminated beast who has lived for over two thousand years. 
                    In his youth, he was enslaved by an ancient god who learned his weakness 
                    and forced to perform cruel, violent acts on the god's behalf, including 
                    devouring the dreams of his victims. The god's bloodthirsty path came to an 
                    end at Morax's hand during the Archon War; Xiao was freed and Morax bestowed 
                    him with the name "Xiao" for his own protection. Xiao became deeply loyal to 
                    the Geo God as a result, a trait that continues to the present day. When Morax
                    rallied the yakshas to help him suppress the lingering hatred and grudges of 
                    fallen gods, Xiao was among those who responded. Xiao, under the name 
                    Alatus, was one of the five foremost Yakshas alongside Bonanus, Bosacius, 
                    Indarias, and Menogias. He also fought alongside many other junior yakshas 
                    such as Pervases. However, over the ages, the yakshas' task wore away their 
                    numbers: Not only did they have to fight against the lingering power of ancient gods, 
                    the hatred that they had to suppress tainted their own souls and mired them in karmic debt, 
                    which incurred enormous physical and psychological pain. Between battle casualties, madness, 
                    and desertion, the number of yakshas eventually dwindled to Bosacius and Xiao. Bosacius, 
                    too, eventually disappeared and left his belongings behind in Minlin, leaving Xiao as the 
                    last Yaksha Guardian. Xiao nearly succumbed to his karmic debt himself at one point, but was 
                    saved by the music Venti played during one of the Anemo Archon's visits to Liyue. While 
                    Xiao's callous exterior can make him appear intimidating, much of his outward personality 
                    stems from his reservations about the violent deeds he has performed and the loss of 
                    his allies over the course of the years. Deep down, Xiao is a gentle soul who is curious 
                    about humanity, but is hesitant to show that side of himself due to his past experiences and 
                    his karma-ridden constitution. Due to the nature of his work, Xiao typically avoids 
                    humans. Not only does he think his bloody past makes him incapable of fitting in, human 
                    souls are less robust than adepti's and his karmic debt taints his surroundings. As a 
                    result, few people even in Liyue know much about him or his role in protecting Liyue. Those 
                    who do know, as well as other adepti, call him the Conqueror of Demons 
                    (Chinese: 降魔大圣 Xiángmó Dàshèng, "Great Sage who Subdues Demons") out of respect.
