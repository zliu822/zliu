					He is an <b><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Adeptus">adeptus</a></b>, under the name Alatus, and the sole surviving member of the five 
					foremost <b><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Yaksha">Yakshas</a></b> dispatched by 
					<b><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Morax">Morax</a></b>, 
					the God of <b><a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Liyue">Liyue</a></b>, 
					to subdue the demonic spirits that plagued Liyue. He is immensely grateful to Morax for 
					saving him, dedicating his life to protecting Liyue as payment. He does not take lightly 
					to those who speak ill of Morax regardless of whoever they are. Despite suffering 
					from constant karmic debt, Xiao is highly resilient towards its alluring corruption, as his 
					fellow yaksha have either succumbed or died to it. Due to this debt, he prefers being alone 
					and rarely involves himself in mortal affairs; in the few times he does have to, he asks 
					they get to the point for their own sake.
